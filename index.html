  <p>In our group discussions, we delved into the concept of an ideal model and successfully identified a preliminary prototype. In this blog post, we will share our exploration process and the discussions surrounding the selection of relevant materials. Ultimately, we decided to use swim rings and waterproof fabric as the adhesive for the base, hollowed out the middle for material filling, and utilized a basic framework for the top construction.</p>
  
  <p>Firstly, our team members engaged in in-depth discussions regarding the concept of the ideal model. We aimed to design a structure that is stable, durable, and innovative to meet our requirements. We considered various design concepts and ultimately determined the base as the core of the model.</p>
  
  <p>In terms of material selection, we pondered and researched extensively. We needed an adhesive material that could securely bond the different parts of the base together. After several trials and comparisons, we settled on swim rings and waterproof fabric as the ideal adhesive materials. Swim rings provided sufficient elasticity and stability, while the waterproof fabric ensured the model's water resistance, enabling it to withstand prolonged usage in moist environments.</p>
  
  <p>To enhance stability and structural strength, we decided to leave a hollow space in the middle of the base and utilize it for material filling. This allowed us to further reinforce the model's structure and ensure its ability to bear weight and pressure. When it came to selecting the filling material, we explored various options, including foam balls, cotton, and plastic particles. Ultimately, we opted for a lightweight filling material to prevent excessive weight while still providing adequate support.</p>
  
  <p>Lastly, to complete the model construction, we chose to employ a basic framework for the top section. This ensured stability and robustness while also allowing flexibility for adjustments and improvements when needed.</p>
  
  <p>Throughout the entire exploration process, we encountered numerous challenges and difficulties. However, our team collaborated closely, overcoming these issues and ultimately achieving the initial construction of our ideal model.</p>
  
  <p>We take great pride in this accomplishment and look forward to further refining and optimizing our model in the future. Through this project, we have gained valuable experience in teamwork, innovative thinking, and problem-solving.</p>
  
  <p>Thank you for reading this blog post. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to leave a comment below. We are excited to share more about the progress of our ideal model with all of you!</p>
